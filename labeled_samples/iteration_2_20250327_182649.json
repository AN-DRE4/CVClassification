I \n\nhad to work with the administrative officials of the bank to get the balance sheet and the same was used to \n\nfind the profit position of the banking institution. The balance sheet was segregated mainly into three \n\ncategories, I.e. 1) Short term loan 2) Medium term Loan 3) Long term Loan. \n\n \n\nOn the study, I came across different features of the loans and their benefits. The bank had lesser rate of \n\ninterest for physically challenged people and farmers.

It has given \n\nthem the visibility on the profit and the losses occurred with the loans. The reports gave them the \n\ncomplete data of their profiting sectors.
