However, the focus on batch processing and mainframe environments suggests that their software development experience is somewhat specialized. Given their 8.5 years of experience, a mid-level designation is appropriate as they likely have a good grasp of software development principles but may not have extensive experience in broader software development roles."

However, there is limited evidence of formal management experience or leadership roles. Therefore, a mid-level designation is appropriate, reflecting their involvement in project management and stakeholder engagement without indicating a full management position."
